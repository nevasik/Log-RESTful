1. Make sure Java and Maven are installed on your computer.

2. Clone the project with your RESTful application using Git, or download it as a ZIP archive and extract it to a
location of your choice.

3. Open a command prompt (for Windows) or a terminal (for Mac or Linux) and navigate to the root folder of the project.

4. Run the `mvn clean install` command to build the project. This command will build your application and create an
executable JAR file in the target folder.

5. Run the application using the command `java -jar target/filename.jar`, where `filename` is the name of the JAR file
created in the previous step.

6. Once the application is running, you can test it by opening a web browser and entering a URL in the format:
`http://localhost:80/`, where `80` is the port your application is running on. If everything is working correctly, you
should see the start page of your application. I hope this guide will help you get your RESTful application up and
running on your local machine. If you have any
questions or problems, ask for help.
